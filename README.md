# JavaScript-For-.NET-Developers
Chapter-wise code examples

This is the code repository for [JavaScript for .NET Developers](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/javascript-net-developers?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785886461), published by Packt Publishing. It contains all the supporting code files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

Throughout the book, we will be using Visual Studio 2015 to practice examples. For the server-side technology, we have used ASP.NET Core for web application development, and used JavaScript on top of it. In Chapter 8, Node.js for ASP.NET Developers, we used Node.js to show how JavaScript can be used on the server side. For Node.js, we will require some extensions for Visual Studio 2015 to be installed, and the details are specified in the chapter.

This book is targeted at .NET developers who have solid programming experience in ASP.NET Core. Throughout this book, we have used ASP.NET Core for web development and assumed that developers have thorough knowledge or working experience in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core.
